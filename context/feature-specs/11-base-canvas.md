Replace the canvas placeholder with a liveblocks-backed React Flow canvas.

## Implementation

1. Keep your workspace page server-side.

2. Create a client-side editor/canvas wrapper that sets up the Liveblocks room.
    
    It should include:
    - `LiveblocksProvider` using `/api/liveblocks-auth`
    - `RoomProvider` using the current room ID
    - Initial presence with `cursor: null`
    - `ClientSideSuspense` with a simple loading state
    - An error fallback for Liveblocks connection issues

3. Wire React Flow to Liveblocks state.
    - Use  `useLiveblocksFlow`
    - Enable suspense
    - Start with empty nodes and edges
    - Pass the synced nodes, edges, and change handlers into `ReactFlow`

4. Add shared canvas types in `types/canvas.ts`

    Node data should support
    - Label
    - Color
    - Shape

    Also define the custom node and edge types:
    - `canvasNode`
    - `canvasEdge`

5. Render the basic canvas. 

    Include:
    - Loose connection behavior
    - `fitView`
    - `MiniMap`
    - Dot-pattern background

## Scope Limits

- Don't add controls yet
- Don't add custom node or edge rendering yet
- Don't add persistence logic
- Don't add AI behavior
- Keep this focused on the collaborative canvas foundation

## Check When Done

- Client canvas wrapper sets up the Liveblocks room
- React Flow uses Liveblocks-synced nodes and edges
- Shared canvas types exist in `type/canvas.ts`
- `npm run build` passes
